# 2-2-and-3-3-Puzzle-
In this project, we'll solve a 2x2 sliding block puzzle using A* and brute force algorithms. We'll compare their performance based on node expansions, peak memory usage, and search steps. The project will then extend to a 3x3 puzzle, analyzing how both algorithms handle increased complexity.
